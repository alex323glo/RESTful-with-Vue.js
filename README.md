## Guide

#### To run Application you must:

1. be sure, that you have pre-installed JVM (Java version 8, or later);
2. be sure, that at this moment no other applications use port:8080 (for example, Tomcat uses port:8080 by default);
3. download or clone this project;
4. open Console in downloaded project's root directory
5. find in project's root directory Gradle Daemon script (for Windows: "gradlew.bat", for Linux/Mac: "gradlew.sh")
6. run it via console with "bootRun" argument (example: execute "./gradlew booRun" in Linux command prompt)
7. open "http://localhost:8080" URL in you browser (or another HTTP Client, which you want to use)
8. enjoy :)
